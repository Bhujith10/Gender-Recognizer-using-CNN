# Gender-Recognizer-using-CNN

The objective of this project is to recognize the gender of people as male or female using Convolutional Neural Networks. The dataset was created by obtaining images from Google Images search. Images of men and women of all age groups were collected to make the classifier make predictions on all faces.

Currently the model is deployed using heroku. Please try it here : https://gender-recognition-cnn.herokuapp.com/. Upload an image of a person and classifier will tell whether the person was male or female.
